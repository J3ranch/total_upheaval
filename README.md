Every decade, a list of the **100 Most Influential People** is drafted up, with a heavy emphasis placed on those in the top 25. Dubbed MIRS (Most Influential 25) by the general populace, these selected few are invited to a conference by NEXT, the world's leading megacorporation.  While the public eye becomes fixated on the NEXT World Conference, no one except the attendees will ever learn what happened behind these closed doors. 

This leads to the conference becoming hijacked by an unknown party. Kidnapped, the attendees are whisked away to an abandoned university. Everyone wakes up discombobulated. Once bearings are found and introductions are made, the school's unusual principal finally reveals himself: **Kingpen, the Crowned Al-Capone Penguin.** Despite his cuddly looks, he thrusts the entire group into a no holds barred killing game.  

Who will die? Who will survive? Who is pulling the strings? Why a penguin!?

Total Upheaval features a main cast of over **18 characters,** each with their own unique virtues and vices. Will you strike a deal with the Silvertongued Salesman? Go on a date with the flirty Weather Idol? Get into a brawl with the Tiger of Hanoi? Not only will you interact with everyone through the main character, but you will also witness individual friendships and cliques form through the game's **side stories.**

There's a lot to glean even from the most minor of interactions.
